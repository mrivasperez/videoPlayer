## About
I created this custom video player to share a custom video player code snippet for people to use on their website. I wanted something that looked cartoonish and fun and good to use for educational or children's website. This project helped me learn how to manipulate HTML5 video controls using the video api and Javascript. I built it using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.
